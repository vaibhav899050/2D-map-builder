# 2D Map Builder

 ***

The idea is to make an app to make high quality<br>
usable 2d maps on the go for solving real world problems.<br>

We'll be having the modules like this:<br>
1. We'll be having 3 activities<br>
      * One will be the splash screen<br>
      * Second where user can make the map<br>
      * Third will be for exporting the map for better use<br><br>
2. In the main activity we have to add the basic building blocks to make the map.
      * Shapes for roads, buildings
      * Location marker
      * canvas
      * containers for containing all the elements of map<br><br>
3. We have to use dynamic widgets.


<br><br>

Main focus will be on how to implement it and not the UI.<br>
we will be using dynamic widgets for creating the widgets programatically.
<br>We will use kotlin and android studio.
